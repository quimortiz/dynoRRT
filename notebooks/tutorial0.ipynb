    "# DynoRRT\n",
    "\n",
    "DynoRRT is a C++/Python library for sampling-based motion planning (e.g., Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT), Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM), etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "It delivers state-of-the-art performance with an easy-to-use and install Python interface. The installation is straightforward: no ROS, no system-wide packages, no MOVEIT, no OMPL; just a simple `pip install`. Plus, it's much faster than OMPL.\n",
    "\n",
    "With DynoRRT, you can write a motion planning problem in 60 seconds and solve it in milliseconds. Planning problems can be defined using URDF Files. We rely on Pinocchio and HPP-FCL for computing collisions and forward kinematics. These are linked statically, so you don't need them at runtime—or it's fine if you have another version of these libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python package is created using pybind11, and the API is very similar to the C++ interface. Additionally, the Python package provides a couple of utilities to visualize the problems using Pinocchio and Meshcat, but you're free to use any viewer you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library is currently in its alpha state. We are targeting a public release of version 0.1 in January. The C++ packaging is still under development. Feel free to open a GitHub issue or pull request! Special help is needed for Mac support :)"
